# Burger App

The Burger App is a fun little App to get familar with MySQL, making a Custom ORM, and becoming familiar with MVC framework. 

## Built With   

* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - Database
* [Handlebarsjs](http://handlebarsjs.com/)  - Front End Framework
* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) with [Express](https://expressjs.com/)

## How it Works

Submit your Favorite Burger (or any food). This data is saved in [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and the data is returned with the option of eating the burger. If you devour the burger it moves to the next column and the database is updated.
